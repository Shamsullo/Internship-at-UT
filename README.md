# Internship-at-UT
This repository is created for sharing my code with my Mentors during my Internship at Unique Technologies. Thus, I will be adding here some of the tasks.

Steps to run the tasks
create a vitual environment, probably by:
pip vitrualenv name_your_env
activate it in the folder where you name_your_env located in windows with bash:
source ./name_your_env/Scripts/activate
then you need to install all the packages which is inside requirements.txt or dependencies.txt to your virtual environment. Make sure you are in the folder where requirements.txt saved
pip install -r requirements.txt/dependencies.txt
after that go to the project folder where you manage.py is and run the local server
python manage.py runserver
now, go to you browser and enter localhost in the search field
